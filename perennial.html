                <h2>Style Guide</h2>
                <p>I wanted Perennial to have an earthy feeling that would represent the sustainable mission of the brand. I went with a light beige as the background color to set the main tone of the app. For accents I used white in order to bring attraction to the buttons and guide the user. I added a forest green accent for when I need to bring extra attention to important functions of the app. Reviewing typography, I was originally going to make the app use Big Caslon consistently but decided that it didnt have the clean look I wanted perennial to emulate so I switched to Avenir instead.</p>

                <h2>Final Screens</h2>
                <p>After some Typography and color challenges I landed on this design. I originally was going to make the apps background white but felt that was boring and decided to go for beige instead. I feel this makes the interface more interesting while prioritizing the earthy look. I also played with the main accent color being forest green instead of white but I found that made the design look clunky and messy. Lastly, settling on the correct way to seperate the checkput process was difficult. I found the best way was to seperate each step in order to not clutter the screen and keep the user on track.</p>

                <h2>Reflections...</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>The main thing I learned while creating this app is to never get attached to one version of your design because you should always be looking to edit and evolve your ideas. While creating this app I went through a lot of different color palettes and always felt strange when I wanted to switch it up because I was afraid of making the app too ‘different’ or just missing the way it used to look.
                </li>
                <li>I also learned that with creating different stylistic choices its always good to have multiple eyes on it. Each style I made I showed to friends to get feedback and this helped me make decisions faster in addition to choosing a design that users would like more.
                </li>
                <li>What helped me create the app and gain UI inspiration was doing deep research on the eco-friendly market. Doing an immense amount of research helped me create the app with ease as I was able to see UI trends as well as how to articulate sustainability goals.
                </li>
                </ul>
